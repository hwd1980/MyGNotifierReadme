MyGNotifier
===========
A simple attempt to create your own GMail Notifier, an awesome tool which has recently passed away.
Set up a main password, put in a valid imap server and gmail credentials and enjoy your new Gmail Notifier.

The application runs in the tray and programmatically scans your imap folder searching for new unread messages.
If it finds new messages a nice pop up will show date, from and subject info.
